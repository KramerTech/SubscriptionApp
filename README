This is a simple webapp to magange user subscriptions to various newletters.

Administrators can add new users and newsletters, and manage* all users' subscriptions.
*Can't add users to newsletters because I didn't get that far.
Login as: admin@neatnews.com/admin

Normal users can only unsubscribe from their current subscriptions.
All default seeded user passwords are "password".
One non-admin email is "testuser@gmail.com", but all user emails can be seen in the admin account.

To launch, clone this repo onto a machine with docker and bash installed, and run start.sh
Testing the backend has not been containerized, but can be done with "npm run dev" from the backend directory. Requires postgres container to be running.

The UI will be available on localhost:8080
The backend will be on localhost:4500, and a health endpoint should be live at its root.
The postgres database is exposed on port 5800.
